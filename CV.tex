%%Summary
\section{Research Interests}
Innovative and collaborative experimental physicist with 10+ years of experience 
searching beyond Standard Model physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). 
Searching for new particles at the LHC is a collaborative work that 
provides an opportunity to lead and work with diverse teams, resulting in the discovery
of the Higgs Boson in July 2012. In the collaboration, I have searched Supersymmetry 
and Exotic particles with a variety of techniques, as well as contributed to detector 
upgrades, published scientific papers, and presented results at major physics conferences.
I am also interested in Dark Matter searches and non-collider experiments.
I conduct research in collaborative and independent environments,  apply Machine Learning
methods to physics research, and have excellent personal and social skills.
